  whatIs:
    "Email tools are browser-based utilities that help marketers, developers, and everyday users work with email more efficiently. The Subject Line Generator produces proven subject line templates for promotional, newsletter, welcome, re-engagement, transactional, and announcement campaigns. The Email Signature Generator builds professional HTML and plain text signatures with live preview — ready to paste into Gmail, Outlook, or Apple Mail. The Email Character Counter shows exactly how your subject line and preview text will be truncated in Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, and iPhone Mail. The Plain Text Formatter strips HTML email markup into clean, readable plain text for multi-part MIME emails. The Email Address Validator checks format syntax for one or hundreds of addresses at once.",

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "What subject line length gets the best open rates?",
      a: "Research consistently shows subject lines of 30–50 characters perform best on mobile, where most email is now read. Short enough to display in full, specific enough to set clear expectations. The Email Character Counter shows exactly where each client truncates.",
    },
    {
      q: "Should I use HTML or plain text email signatures?",
      a: "For most modern email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail), HTML signatures render well and look more professional. However, some corporate IT systems strip HTML. Set up an HTML signature as your primary and keep a plain text version as a backup — the signature generator provides both.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why do I need a plain text version of my HTML email?",
      a: "Major email platforms (Mailchimp, Klaviyo, etc.) require a plain text version because some clients and email proxies display plain text only. The presence of a multi-part MIME message (HTML + text) is also a positive spam filter signal.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is email syntax validation?",
      a: "Syntax validation checks whether an email address follows the correct format: a valid local part (before @), an @ symbol, a valid domain, and a TLD of at least two characters. It does not verify that the mailbox actually exists or that the domain has MX records.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is preview text (preheader) in email?",
      a: "Preview text is the short snippet shown after the subject line in the inbox list view. It's either a hidden <span> element at the top of your HTML or pulled from the first visible text. Aim for 40–100 characters. The Email Character Counter tracks both subject and preview text limits.",
    },
    {
      q: "Are all email tools free?",
      a: "Yes — all tools on X Toolkit are 100% free with no account, subscription, or trial required. Your email content is processed entirely in your browser and is never stored or transmitted.",

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4">Email Deliverability: The Complete Picture</h2>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Email deliverability is the ability of your emails to actually reach recipients' inboxes rather than being filtered into spam folders or bounced entirely. It is determined by a combination of technical factors (SPF, DKIM, DMARC records), sending reputation (your domain and IP's history), list quality (how many invalid or disengaged addresses you send to), and content quality (whether your emails look like spam).</p>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-3">The most preventable deliverability issues are list quality problems — sending to invalid email addresses, role-based accounts, and disposable domains that inflate your bounce rate and spam complaint rate. A single campaign to a dirty list can permanently damage your sender reputation with major email providers. Our Email Validator helps you catch these problems before they cause damage.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4">Understanding Email Character Limits</h2>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Every email client displays subject lines and preview text differently. Gmail on desktop shows approximately 70 characters. Gmail on mobile shows 30–40 characters depending on screen size. Apple iPhone Mail shows 30–40 characters. Outlook shows 60–70 characters. Beyond these limits, your subject line is truncated with an ellipsis — cutting off your message mid-sentence.</p>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-3">The most important practical rule: put the most important information in the first 30–40 characters of your subject line. Do not front-load your subject with the newsletter name, date, or company name — these take up valuable space that should be used to communicate value. Our Email Character Counter shows exactly where each major client truncates, so you can optimize for your audience's primary device.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4">Professional Email Signatures in 2026</h2>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Email signatures have evolved significantly. In 2026, effective professional signatures are concise (4–6 lines maximum), mobile-friendly (designed for small screens first), and include exactly what the recipient needs to follow up — nothing more. The trend is toward simpler, cleaner signatures that load quickly and render well in all clients.</p>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-3">The most important elements in priority order: your name (large and clear), your title and company, one phone number (direct line preferred), your website URL, and optionally 1–2 social profiles relevant to your professional context. Avoid: inspirational quotes, legal disclaimers in signatures (use proper legal footers instead), multiple logos, animated GIFs, and background images — all of which cause rendering issues in various clients.</p>
