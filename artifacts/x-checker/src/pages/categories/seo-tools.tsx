  whatIs:
    "SEO tools are utilities that help you audit and optimize the on-page elements that search engines use to understand, rank, and display your content. The Meta Tag Generator builds SEO-optimized title tags, meta descriptions, Open Graph tags, and Twitter Card tags with a live SERP preview showing exactly how your page will look in Google results. The Keyword Density Checker measures how frequently a target keyword appears in a piece of content, helping you hit the optimal 1–3% range without keyword stuffing. The URL Slug Generator converts any title or phrase into a clean, hyphenated, lowercase URL slug that follows SEO best practices. The Robots.txt Generator lets you configure crawl rules for any search engine bot, block AI scrapers, and add your sitemap URL. The Sitemap Validator checks your XML sitemap for structural errors, invalid dates, and URL format issues.",

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "What is the ideal meta title length for SEO?",
      a: "Google typically displays the first 50–60 characters of a page title. Keep meta titles between 50–60 characters for best results. The Meta Tag Generator shows a live SERP preview and flags titles that are too long or too short.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is keyword density and what range is ideal?",
      a: "Keyword density is the percentage of times a target keyword appears relative to total word count. The recommended range is 1–3%. Below 1% may not signal relevance strongly enough; above 4% risks a keyword stuffing flag from Google.",
    },
    {
      q: "Should I use hyphens or underscores in URL slugs?",
      a: "Always use hyphens. Google treats hyphens as word separators (so 'seo-tools' = two words: 'seo' + 'tools'), but treats underscores as character joiners ('seo_tools' = one word). Hyphens are the universal best practice.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does robots.txt prevent pages from being indexed?",
      a: "No — robots.txt controls crawling, not indexing. A blocked page can still appear in search results if other pages link to it. To prevent indexing, use a 'noindex' meta tag or X-Robots-Tag HTTP header in addition to or instead of robots.txt.",
    },
    {
      q: "How many URLs can an XML sitemap contain?",
      a: "Each sitemap file can contain a maximum of 50,000 URLs and must not exceed 50 MB uncompressed. For larger sites, use a sitemap index file that points to multiple individual sitemaps.",
    },
    {
      q: "Are all these SEO tools free?",
      a: "Yes — all SEO tools on X Toolkit are completely free with no subscription, trial, or account required. All processing happens in your browser or via stateless API calls — nothing is stored.",

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4">On-Page SEO Fundamentals</h2>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">On-page SEO refers to all the optimizations you make directly on your web pages to improve their visibility in search engines. Unlike off-page SEO (backlinks, social signals, domain authority), on-page SEO is entirely within your control and should be your first priority before investing in link building.</p>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-3">The most impactful on-page SEO elements are: the title tag (the biggest single ranking signal on the page), the meta description (affects click-through rate from search results), the URL structure (should be short and keyword-rich), heading hierarchy (H1 through H6 should follow logical structure with keywords in H1), content depth and relevance, and internal linking structure. Our SEO tools cover all of these areas, giving you practical utilities for each.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4">Meta Tags and SERP Appearance</h2>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Search engine results pages (SERPs) show your title tag and meta description as your page's "advertisement" in search results. A well-written title and description can significantly increase your click-through rate even if your ranking position stays the same — getting you more traffic without improving your ranking.</p>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-3">Google rewrites title tags and meta descriptions when it believes its version will perform better. To minimize rewrites: write titles that are descriptive and match the page content closely, stay under 60 characters for titles and 160 for descriptions, include your target keyword naturally (not forced), and avoid excessive capitalization, symbols, or repeated keywords. Our Meta Tag Generator shows a live SERP preview so you can optimize before publishing rather than guessing how it will look in results.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4">Robots.txt and Crawl Budget</h2>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">The robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which pages to crawl and which to skip. For most small sites it is not a critical ranking factor — crawlers will index everything accessible anyway. However for large sites (thousands of pages), e-commerce stores with faceted navigation, or sites with significant non-public areas, robots.txt helps focus crawl budget on the pages that matter most.</p>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-3">Common robots.txt use cases: blocking crawlers from admin areas, staging environments, user account pages, search result pages, and print versions. Also valuable: blocking AI training scrapers using rules for GPTBot, CCBot, and other AI crawlers that have been added to well-maintained robots.txt files. Our Robots.txt Generator provides a complete interface for setting up all these rules without needing to write the syntax manually.</p>
