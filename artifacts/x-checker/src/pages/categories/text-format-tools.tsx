  whatIs:
    "Text and formatting tools are utilities that help you shape, style, and organize your X (Twitter) content before it goes live. The Tweet Thread Formatter takes a long piece of writing and automatically splits it into numbered tweet-sized chunks with correct character limits — no manual cutting needed. The Character Counter tracks characters, words, and sentences in real time so you always know exactly how close you are to X's 280-character limit. Font Preview lets you see your text rendered in Unicode-based decorative and stylistic fonts before copying the result into your bio or tweet. The Hashtag Formatter deduplicates and normalizes messy hashtag lists. Username Generator creates available-style handle ideas for any niche, and Display Name Ideas helps you find a memorable, on-brand name for your profile.",

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "How does the Tweet Thread Formatter split content?",
      a: "The formatter splits text at sentence boundaries whenever a segment would exceed the per-tweet character limit (280 characters by default). Each segment is automatically numbered (1/, 2/, 3/) and you can copy the entire thread or individual tweets.",
    },
    {
      q: "What fonts does the Font Preview tool support?",
      a: "It supports a wide range of Unicode-compatible character sets including bold, italic, bold-italic, monospace, script, double-struck, and several decorative styles. All characters are valid Unicode codepoints that render on X without any special app.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does the Character Counter count in the same way as X?",
      a: "Yes. The counter uses the same logic as X's native character counting: URLs count as 23 characters regardless of their actual length, and emoji count as 2 characters. The remaining character display updates in real time.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is my text sent to a server when I use these tools?",
      a: "No. All text processing for these tools (thread splitting, character counting, font conversion, hashtag formatting) happens entirely in your browser. Your text never leaves your device.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I use the Username Generator for platforms other than X?",
      a: "Yes. The generated usernames follow common handle conventions (short, no spaces, easy to type) so they work well on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, or any platform that uses @-style handles.",
    },
    {
      q: "What does the Hashtag Formatter actually do?",
      a: "It takes a messy list of hashtags — separated by commas, spaces, or newlines — removes duplicates, ensures each one starts with a single #, fixes spacing, and outputs a clean formatted list ready to paste at the end of your post.",
    },
