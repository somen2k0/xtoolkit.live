const faqs = [
  { q: "What is an email leak?", a: "An email leak occurs when your email address is exposed without your consent — through data breaches (company hacks), email harvesting bots, list selling by services you signed up for, or phishing. Once leaked, your address spreads across spam networks and is nearly impossible to fully remove." },
  { q: "How do I find out if my email was leaked?", a: "The most reliable free resource is HaveIBeenPwned.com (haveibeenpwned.com), maintained by security researcher Troy Hunt. It tracks over 12 billion accounts from known public breaches. Enter your email and it shows which breaches included it." },
  { q: "Can I remove my email from breach databases?", a: "No — data from public breaches is already distributed across thousands of servers and dark web markets. You cannot remove it. The only effective approach is to stop using the compromised address, change associated passwords, and use unique aliases for new signups going forward." },
  { q: "Does this tool check if my email was leaked?", a: "No. This is an educational guide explaining how leaks happen and what to do about them. To actually check your email, use HaveIBeenPwned.com — it's free, trustworthy, and used by governments and security professionals worldwide." },
  { q: "What should I do if my email was in a breach?", a: "Immediately change the password on the breached service. Change it on any other services where you used the same password. Enable two-factor authentication where available. Monitor your other accounts for unusual activity. Consider switching to a fresh email address for important services." },
