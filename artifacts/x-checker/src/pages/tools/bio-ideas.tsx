  { q: "What makes a great Twitter bio?", a: "A great Twitter bio clearly communicates who you are, what you do, and why someone should follow you — all in 160 characters or less. The best bios either establish credibility (role, achievements), show personality, or create curiosity. Always include a concrete benefit for the reader." },
  { q: "How long can a Twitter bio be?", a: "Twitter allows up to 160 characters for your bio. That's about 2-3 short sentences or one punchy paragraph. Use every character wisely — start with your strongest hook and cut anything that doesn't add value." },
  { q: "Should I use emojis in my Twitter bio?", a: "Yes, strategically. 1-3 relevant emojis can make your bio more visually appealing and help break up text. Use emojis that reinforce your message (e.g., 💻 for tech, 📊 for data). Avoid using emojis as pure decoration or overdoing it." },
  { q: "Can I use these bio templates directly?", a: "These are starting templates — replace the [bracketed placeholders] with your specific details. Customize the tone, niche, and achievements to match your real story. A personalized bio always outperforms a generic one." },
  { q: "How often should I update my Twitter bio?", a: "Update your bio whenever your role, focus, or goals change. A stale bio that says you're still at a company you left 2 years ago hurts credibility. Many power users update their bio seasonally or when launching something new." },
  { q: "What's the difference between a Twitter bio and a Twitter name?", a: "Your Twitter name (display name) is shown prominently at the top of your profile and in feeds. It can be up to 50 characters. Your bio is the description below your name and is limited to 160 characters. Both contribute to first impressions." },
