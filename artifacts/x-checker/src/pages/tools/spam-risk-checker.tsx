Addresses with generic names, disposable domains, or trigger keywords in the username have higher risk." },
  { q: "Why do generic email addresses get more spam?", a: "Addresses like info@, admin@, and contact@ are typically guessed by spam bots rather than harvested from leaks. They're publicly expected to exist at any domain, so bots try them systematically." },
  { q: "Does a low spam risk mean I won't get spam?", a: "No. Spam depends on many factors beyond the address itself — whether it's been exposed in breaches, shared with advertisers, or scraped from websites. This checker evaluates structural risk only." },
  { q: "Is this the same as an email deliverability checker?", a: "No. Deliverability (whether your outbound emails reach the inbox) is a separate concern. This tool evaluates inbound spam risk for the address you entered." },
  { q: "How can I reduce spam?", a: "Use unique aliases per service (SimpleLogin, AnonAddy), avoid using your real email on public websites, use unsubscribe links only for legitimate services, and enable your email provider's spam filtering." },
