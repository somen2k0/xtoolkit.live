      <h2>The Short Answer</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Yes — for its intended use cases, temp mail is safe.</strong> It protects your real inbox from spam, prevents companies from building advertising profiles on you, and keeps your primary email address private from low-trust services.
      </p>
      <p>However, it has specific risks that make it <em>unsafe</em> in other contexts. Understanding both sides helps you use it correctly.</p>

      <h2>What Temp Mail Protects You From</h2>

      <h3>Spam &amp; Marketing Email</h3>
      <p>The primary protection. Any mailing list, drip campaign, or promotional blast sent to your temp address never reaches your real inbox. When the temp address expires, all future mail to it vanishes.</p>

      <h3>Data Broker Harvesting</h3>
      <p>Data brokers compile profiles from email addresses — linking them to purchases, website visits, location data, and social media. A disposable address that expires cannot be correlated across sessions, breaking this profiling.</p>

      <h3>Cross-Site Tracking</h3>
      <p>Many sites share email addresses with advertising networks for cross-site retargeting. A temp address can't be used to follow you across the web, since it's not tied to your identity.</p>

      <h3>Corporate Data Breaches</h3>
      <p>If a service you signed up for is breached, your temp address is exposed — not your real one. The leaked address is already abandoned, so it can't be used to access your accounts or spam your real inbox.</p>

      <h2>Real Risks You Should Know About</h2>

      <h3>The Provider Can Read Your Emails</h3>
      <p>This is the most important risk. Temporary email services are <strong>not end-to-end encrypted</strong>. The provider's servers receive your messages in plaintext. A malicious or compromised temp mail provider could harvest message content — including verification links, one-time codes, and personal details in confirmation emails.</p>
      <p><strong>Rule:</strong> Never use a temp mail address for anything sensitive. No banking confirmations, no medical information, no private messages.</p>

      <h3>Public Inboxes</h3>
      <p>Some providers (most notably Mailinator) operate <strong>public inboxes</strong> — any inbox is accessible to anyone who knows the address. If someone guesses or monitors your address, they can read your messages and steal verification codes.</p>
      <p>Services using session-based authentication (like our X Toolkit Temp Mail) are not public by default — only someone with your session token can access the inbox.</p>

      <h3>No Account Recovery</h3>
      <p>If you use a temp address to register for a service and later lose access to that service, there's no email-based recovery path. The inbox is gone. This is a non-issue for truly throwaway accounts, but a serious problem if you accidentally use a temp address for something important.</p>

      <h3>Not Suitable for Identity Verification</h3>
      <p>Banks, government services, and financial platforms often reject known disposable domains and require verified email addresses. Even if not blocked, using a temp address means you cannot complete identity verification (KYC) processes that require documented ownership of an email address.</p>

      <h3>Messages Expire</h3>
      <p>Most providers auto-delete messages within 1–24 hours. If you need a verification email to arrive later, or if you need to reference a confirmation, you may lose access to it.</p>

      <h2>How to Use Temp Mail Safely</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use session-persistent services</strong> — choose providers that store your session in the browser so a refresh doesn't lose your inbox</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid public inbox providers</strong> for anything with a one-time code or verification link</li>
        <li><strong>Never use temp mail for important accounts</strong> — banking, social media you'll keep, professional services</li>
        <li><strong>Act on verification emails quickly</strong> before they expire</li>
        <li><strong>Use HTTPS services only</strong> — make sure the temp mail service itself uses a secure connection</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Is Our Temp Mail Tool Safe?</h2>
      <p>Our <strong>Temp Mail</strong> tool uses session-based authentication — your inbox is not public. Your session token is stored in your browser, so only you can access your inbox. Sessions persist across page refreshes.</p>
      <p>That said, the same principle applies: don't use it for sensitive communications. It's designed for throwaway registrations, not private messaging.</p>

      <h2>When Temp Mail Is Not the Right Tool</h2>
      <p>Use your real email (or a privacy-focused provider like ProtonMail) when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You'll need the account for more than a day</li>
        <li>Password recovery matters</li>
        <li>The service involves financial data</li>
        <li>You're exchanging sensitive personal information</li>
        <li>Identity verification is required</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For long-term privacy without these limitations, consider a permanent <strong>email alias</strong> (SimpleLogin, AnonAddy) — you get the same anonymity as temp mail, but the inbox persists and you can recover accounts through it.</p>
