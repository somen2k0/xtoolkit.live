      <h2>The Core Difference</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Gmail</strong> is a permanent, account-based email service from Google. It requires signup, is linked to your identity, and persists indefinitely. Google uses your activity across Gmail for ad targeting and product improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Temp mail</strong> (temporary or disposable email) requires no signup, has no identity link, and expires after a session or short time period. It receives real emails, but once you leave, the inbox is gone.
      </p>
      <p>They're not competitors — they serve completely different purposes. Understanding when each is appropriate prevents both inbox overload and lost accounts.</p>

      <h2>Side-by-Side Comparison</h2>

      <h3>Setup &amp; Identity</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gmail:</strong> Requires name, phone number, date of birth. Tied to a Google account and all associated services (Drive, Docs, YouTube, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Temp Mail:</strong> Zero setup. Open a browser, get an address. No name, no phone, no account of any kind.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Privacy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gmail:</strong> Google scans metadata to serve ads. Your email history is stored indefinitely. Deleted emails remain in Google's infrastructure for up to 60 days. Google has complied with government data requests involving Gmail.</li>
        <li><strong>Temp Mail:</strong> No identity attached. No persistent storage. Inbox disappears after session. No advertising profile is built. However, the temp mail provider can read incoming message content — it's not encrypted.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Lifespan</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gmail:</strong> Permanent (unless you delete the account or Google suspends it).</li>
        <li><strong>Temp Mail:</strong> Temporary. Depending on the provider, messages expire in 1 hour to 24 hours. Some providers (mail.tm) offer longer-lived accounts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Spam Protection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gmail:</strong> Industry-leading spam filtering. But once your address is harvested or sold, spam accumulates permanently in your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Temp Mail:</strong> Spam is a non-issue. When the inbox expires, the spam goes with it. You simply create a new address next time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Account Recovery</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gmail:</strong> Full recovery options — phone, backup email, identity verification.</li>
        <li><strong>Temp Mail:</strong> No recovery. If you used a temp address to register for a service, that account cannot be recovered through email if you lose access.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Deliverability</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gmail:</strong> Accepted almost universally. High sender reputation. Major services actively want Gmail addresses for marketing purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Temp Mail:</strong> Blocked by many services (banks, government sites, some apps). Disposable domains are maintained in blocklists that prevent registration.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Cost</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gmail:</strong> Free, but you pay with your data.</li>
        <li><strong>Temp Mail:</strong> Completely free. No data exchange of any kind.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to Use Gmail</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your primary personal or professional email identity</li>
        <li>Services you'll use long-term and may need to recover</li>
        <li>Anywhere email deliverability is critical</li>
        <li>When Google integration (Drive, Calendar, Docs) is useful</li>
        <li>Banking, financial accounts, and official services</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to Use Temp Mail</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>One-time signups for content, trials, or forums</li>
        <li>Registrations you know will result in spam</li>
        <li>Developer and QA testing (create unlimited inboxes instantly)</li>
        <li>Any situation where you want zero traceability</li>
        <li>Accessing gated content without entering a marketing funnel</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What About "Temp Gmail"?</h2>
      <p>You may have heard of "temp Gmail" — this refers to the <strong>Gmail dot trick</strong> and <strong>Gmail plus trick</strong>, which let you generate variations of your Gmail address that all deliver to the same inbox.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dot trick:</strong> Gmail ignores dots — <code>john.doe@gmail.com</code> and <code>johndoe@gmail.com</code> deliver to the same inbox. This lets you register on sites that check for duplicate emails.</li>
        <li><strong>Plus trick:</strong> <code>you+spam@gmail.com</code> still delivers to <code>you@gmail.com</code>. Useful for filtering, but your base address is visible to anyone who inspects the message headers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These aren't truly anonymous — your real Gmail address is always traceable. For actual anonymity, use a proper temporary or alias email service.</p>

      <h2>The Privacy Stack: Best of Both</h2>
      <p>Privacy-conscious users often combine both approaches:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>A privacy-focused permanent email</strong> (ProtonMail, Tutanota) as their real identity — not Gmail</li>
        <li><strong>A permanent alias service</strong> (SimpleLogin, AnonAddy) for subscriptions and long-term accounts</li>
        <li><strong>Temp mail</strong> for truly throwaway registrations</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Gmail sits in the middle: convenient, functional, but not private. For anything where privacy actually matters, there are better options at every tier.</p>
