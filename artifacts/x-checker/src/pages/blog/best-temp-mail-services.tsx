      <h2>How We Compared These Services</h2>
      <p>We evaluated each provider on: domain variety (to avoid domain blocklists), inbox persistence, custom usernames, privacy policy, ease of use, and any unique features. All services listed here are completely free unless otherwise noted.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>1. X Toolkit Temp Mail — Best Overall Free Option</h2>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> General use, developer testing, everyday throwaway signups.</p>
      <p>Our built-in <strong>Temp Mail</strong> tool gives you access to <strong>9 domains</strong> from a single interface — one of the widest domain selections available. This matters because many services blocklist specific disposable domains, so having more options means you'll almost always find one that works.</p>
      <p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>9 domains — rotate automatically if one is blocked</li>
        <li>Custom username — choose your own local part</li>
        <li>Session persists across page refreshes</li>
        <li>Auto-refresh every 15 seconds</li>
        <li>Domain switching without losing messages</li>
        <li>Full HTML email rendering</li>
        <li>Gmail dot trick and plus trick generators included</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Messages expire with your session. Not end-to-end encrypted.</p>

      <h2>2. Mailinator — Best for QA Teams</h2>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Large QA teams and automated testing environments.</p>
      <p>Mailinator uses <strong>fully public inboxes</strong> — no session or account needed. Any inbox at mailinator.com (or partnered domains) is accessible by anyone who knows the address. This makes it unsuitable for anything sensitive, but excellent for team testing environments where multiple people need to check the same test inbox.</p>
      <p>Mailinator's free tier includes several domains. Its paid plans add private inboxes, webhooks, and custom domains.</p>

      <h2>3. 10MinuteMail — Best for Ultra-Quick Use</h2>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> When you need a one-use address immediately and don't need features.</p>
      <p>The simplest possible interface: visit, get an address, use it. The inbox self-destructs in 10 minutes (extendable to 20 with a button click). No customization, no domain choice, no API. Just maximum simplicity for the one-click use case.</p>

      <h2>4. Temp-Mail.org — Best Mobile Experience</h2>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Mobile users who need a simple temp inbox.</p>
      <p>Temp-Mail.org has well-rated iOS and Android apps, making it one of the better mobile experiences for temporary email. Supports multiple domains and has QR code sharing for moving an address between devices.</p>

      <h2>5. Inboxes (inboxes.com) — Best for Teams</h2>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Small teams that need shared temporary inboxes.</p>
      <p>Inboxes offers unlimited shared inboxes without signup. All team members can see incoming mail. Useful for testing transactional email flows where multiple people need visibility, without coordinating logins.</p>

      <h2>Summary: Which Service to Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>General use / widest domain selection:</strong> X Toolkit Temp Mail (9 domains, persistent session)</li>
        <li><strong>Public shared team testing:</strong> Mailinator</li>
        <li><strong>Maximum simplicity:</strong> 10MinuteMail</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile:</strong> Temp-Mail.org</li>
        <li><strong>Team collaboration:</strong> Inboxes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What About Permanent Alias Services?</h2>
      <p>If you need a temp-style address that <em>never expires</em> and forwards to your real inbox, the above are the wrong tools. Consider <strong>SimpleLogin</strong> (free, 10 aliases) or <strong>AnonAddy</strong> (free, unlimited aliases) for permanent anonymous forwarding that you can disable per-service.</p>
