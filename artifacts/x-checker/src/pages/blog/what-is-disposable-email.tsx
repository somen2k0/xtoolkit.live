      <h2>What Is a Disposable Email Address?</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>disposable email address</strong> (also called a temporary email, throwaway email, or fake email) is a real, functioning email inbox that you use once — or for a short period — and then discard. It receives messages like any normal inbox, but it's not linked to your identity, and you abandon it when you're done.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key difference from your regular email: there's no signup, no password, and no long-term commitment. You get an address, use it, and walk away. Any spam that follows goes to an inbox you've already thrown away.
      </p>

      <h2>How Does Disposable Email Work?</h2>
      <p>When you open a disposable email service, it generates a random address — something like <code>swift.inbox.482@tempmail.net</code>. This address is real and can receive emails from anyone. The service displays incoming messages in a web-based inbox that only you can access (typically through a session token stored in your browser).</p>
      <p>When you close the browser tab or the session expires, the inbox is gone. Emails received afterward are either discarded or held briefly depending on the provider.</p>
      <p>The process looks like this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>You visit a temp mail service (like our free <strong>Temp Mail</strong> tool)</li>
        <li>An address is generated automatically — no signup needed</li>
        <li>You give that address to a website requiring email verification</li>
        <li>The verification email arrives in your temporary inbox</li>
        <li>You click the link, complete registration, and close the tab</li>
        <li>The disposable inbox vanishes — along with any future emails sent to it</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Why Do People Use Disposable Email?</h2>
      <p>The core motivation is <strong>inbox hygiene</strong>. Your real email address accumulates spam over time because:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Companies sell your address to "marketing partners"</li>
        <li>Data breaches expose your address to spam networks</li>
        <li>Bots harvest addresses from public web pages</li>
        <li>Aggressive retargeting follows you after a single signup</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By using a disposable email for any non-essential signup, you prevent these attack vectors from ever reaching your real inbox.</p>
      <p>Common use cases include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Free trials</strong> — access SaaS products without triggering a sales sequence</li>
        <li><strong>Gated content</strong> — download whitepapers and ebooks without entering the marketing funnel</li>
        <li><strong>Forums and communities</strong> — register without revealing your identity</li>
        <li><strong>Developer testing</strong> — create infinite test inboxes without spinning up real accounts</li>
        <li><strong>E-commerce</strong> — complete a one-time purchase without receiving promotional emails forever</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Disposable Email vs Alias Email: What's the Difference?</h2>
      <p>Many people confuse disposable email with <strong>email aliases</strong>. They serve similar privacy goals but work differently:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Disposable email</strong> is temporary. The inbox exists briefly and is discarded. No connection to your real address.</li>
        <li><strong>Email alias</strong> is permanent. It forwards messages to your real inbox indefinitely. You can disable specific aliases when they start receiving spam.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For one-time signups, disposable is ideal. For services you'll actually use long-term (subscriptions, apps you keep using), a permanent alias from SimpleLogin or AnonAddy is better — you get the same anonymity but maintain access.</p>

      <h2>Limitations of Disposable Email</h2>
      <p>Disposable email isn't a silver bullet. Important limitations to understand:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Many services block it</strong> — banks, government sites, and some apps maintain blocklists of known disposable domains. Your registration may fail.</li>
        <li><strong>No account recovery</strong> — if you later need to reset a password or verify your account, the old inbox is gone.</li>
        <li><strong>Messages expire</strong> — most providers delete messages within 1–24 hours. Don't store anything important there.</li>
        <li><strong>Not private for sensitive communication</strong> — the provider can read message content. Never send sensitive information to a temporary inbox.</li>
        <li><strong>Some inboxes are public</strong> — on providers like Mailinator, anyone who knows your address can access the inbox.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Is Using Disposable Email Legal?</h2>
      <p>Yes, completely. Using a disposable email is no different from having two email accounts. The only edge case: some platforms' terms of service prohibit creating multiple accounts, and using a fresh disposable address to create a second account on the same platform may violate those terms — but that's an issue of account policy, not the use of a temporary email address itself.</p>

      <h2>Best Disposable Email Services</h2>
      <p>Not all temp mail providers are equal. The best ones offer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Multiple domains</strong> — so blocked domains have alternatives</li>
        <li><strong>Session persistence</strong> — your inbox survives a page refresh</li>
        <li><strong>Custom usernames</strong> — so you can choose a memorable address</li>
        <li><strong>Fast delivery</strong> — emails arrive within seconds</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our <strong>Temp Mail</strong> tool supports 9 domains, lets you customize your username and switch domains, and preserves your session across refreshes — all for free, with no signup.</p>

      <h2>When Should You Use Your Real Email?</h2>
      <p>Disposable email isn't right for everything. Use your real email for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bank accounts and financial services</li>
        <li>Government and official identification</li>
        <li>Services you'll rely on long-term (your cloud storage, your work tools)</li>
        <li>Any account where you'll need password recovery in the future</li>
        <li>Professional communications where identity matters</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For everything else — especially one-time signups and trial accounts — a disposable address is the smarter choice.</p>
