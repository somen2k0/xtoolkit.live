      <h2>What Is a Temp Email Chrome Extension?</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>temp email Chrome extension</strong> is a browser add-on that gives you a disposable email inbox directly in your toolbar — no website visit, no new tab, no signup. You click the extension icon, copy the generated address, and use it wherever a site asks for your email. Verification codes arrive instantly in the popup's inbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key difference from visiting a temp mail website is convenience: the extension stays one click away on every page, so you can complete email-gated signups, downloads, or registrations without ever navigating away from what you were doing.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Use an Extension Instead of a Temp Mail Website?</h2>
      <p>Both approaches create disposable inboxes, but an extension is faster in practice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No tab switching</strong> — open the popup, copy your address, close it. The page you were on is still open.</li>
        <li><strong>Background polling</strong> — the extension checks for new emails every 15 seconds even when you're not looking at it, then notifies you the moment a message arrives.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic OTP detection</strong> — it scans every incoming email for verification codes and surfaces them with a one-click Copy button, so you never have to read through an email to find a 6-digit number.</li>
        <li><strong>Keyboard shortcut</strong> — press <code>Alt+Shift+C</code> anywhere to copy your active temp email address to the clipboard without opening the popup at all.</li>
        <li><strong>Inbox history</strong> — previously generated addresses are saved locally, so you can switch back to an old inbox if needed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 1 — Install the Extension</h2>
      <p>
        The X Toolkit extension is available for free from the Chrome Web Store. It works on Google Chrome, Brave, Microsoft Edge, Arc, and Opera — any Chromium-based browser.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <strong>xtoolkit.live/chrome-extension</strong> and click <em>Add to Chrome — It's Free</em>, or search "X Toolkit" in the Chrome Web Store.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Add extension</strong> in the confirmation dialog.</li>
        <li>Click the puzzle-piece icon in your browser toolbar, find <em>X Toolkit</em>, and click the <strong>pin</strong> icon so it stays visible.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The extension requires no account and no personal information. The only permissions it requests are: <code>storage</code> (saves your inbox session locally), <code>notifications</code> (new email alerts), <code>alarms</code> (background polling), <code>contextMenus</code> (right-click copy), and <code>clipboardWrite</code> (one-click copy). It only communicates with <code>xtoolkit.live</code> — no third-party servers.</p>

      <h2>Step 2 — Generate Your First Disposable Inbox</h2>
      <p>
        Click the X Toolkit icon in your toolbar. On first launch, a temp email address is generated automatically — something like <code>jennifer.smith@oakon.com</code>. Click the address to copy it to your clipboard.
      </p>
      <p>If you want a different address, click <strong>New</strong> to generate a fresh one. The extension cycles through multiple email providers and domains, so if one is blocked by a site you're signing up for, simply regenerate to get a new domain.</p>
      <p>Paste the address wherever the website asks for your email and proceed with registration. The inbox polls automatically — you don't need to do anything else.</p>

      <h2>Step 3 — Receive Emails and Copy Your OTP</h2>
      <p>
        When an email arrives, the popup inbox updates automatically (every 15 seconds) and a desktop notification appears. Click the notification or open the extension to see your messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the email contains a verification code, the extension detects it automatically and displays a highlighted <strong>Verification Code</strong> card at the top of your inbox — with the code shown in large monospace text and a single <strong>Copy</strong> button. You never need to open the full email to read a 6-digit number again.
      </p>
      <p>The OTP detector scans both the email subject and body for 4–8 digit codes, alphanumeric tokens, and common patterns like "Your code is: 482910" or "Confirmation code — 7743".</p>

      <h2>Step 4 — Use the Gmail Tab for Blocked Domains</h2>
      <p>
        Some websites — banks, government portals, major apps — block known disposable email domains. For these, switch to the <strong>Gmail</strong> tab inside the extension.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gmail tab generates a real <code>@gmail.com</code> address using Gmail's dot-trick (inserting dots into your username). Emails sent to these dot-trick addresses arrive in a genuine Gmail inbox that you can read right inside the extension popup — because Gmail treats all dot variants of the same username as one inbox.
      </p>
      <p>You can also use the <strong>Gmail Tricks</strong> sub-tab to generate an unlimited list of dot-trick and plus-tag variants from any Gmail address you already own. This is useful for testing how a site handles multiple accounts, or for filtering emails by where you signed up.</p>

      <h2>Step 5 — Get Notified in the Background</h2>
      <p>
        You don't need to keep the extension popup open. A Manifest V3 service worker runs silently in the background and checks your inbox every 15 seconds. When new mail arrives, Chrome shows a desktop notification with the sender and subject line.
      </p>
      <p>To enable notifications the first time, Chrome will ask for permission — click <strong>Allow</strong>. You can manage notification preferences at any time in <code>chrome://settings/content/notifications</code>.</p>

      <h2>The Keyboard Shortcut — Copy Without Opening the Popup</h2>
      <p>
        Once you have an active inbox, press <code>Alt+Shift+C</code> from any tab to instantly copy your temp email address to the clipboard. This is the fastest way to fill in email fields — you don't even need to see the extension.
      </p>
      <p>To change the shortcut, go to <code>chrome://extensions/shortcuts</code>, find X Toolkit, and assign any key combination you prefer.</p>

      <h2>Managing Your Inbox History</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>History</strong> tab inside the extension lists every address you've generated, sorted by date. Tap any entry to switch back to that inbox and check for messages. Sessions are stored locally in Chrome's storage and persist across browser restarts — so if you close Chrome and reopen it, your current inbox is still active.
      </p>
      <p>To clear all saved addresses and start fresh, use the <em>Clear history</em> option in the History tab. This does not delete any emails — it only removes the local record of addresses you've used.</p>

      <h2>When to Use a Temp Email Extension (and When Not To)</h2>
      <p>A disposable email extension is the right tool for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Free trials</strong> — sign up without entering the marketing funnel</li>
        <li><strong>Gated downloads</strong> — get the file or ebook without giving up your real email</li>
        <li><strong>Forum and community registrations</strong> — join without revealing your identity</li>
        <li><strong>Developer testing</strong> — generate infinite test inboxes for automated sign-up flows</li>
        <li><strong>One-time purchases</strong> — complete checkout without receiving promotional emails forever</li>
        <li><strong>Any site you're trying for the first time</strong> — protect your real inbox until you decide if the service is worth trusting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Avoid using temp email for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bank accounts, financial services, or government sites — you'll need account recovery later</li>
        <li>Services you plan to use long-term — you won't be able to receive important emails once the inbox expires</li>
        <li>Any communication involving sensitive personal information — disposable inboxes are not encrypted private channels</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Temp Email Extension vs Visiting a Temp Mail Website</h2>
      <p>
        If you only occasionally need a throwaway inbox, visiting <strong>xtoolkit.live/tools/temp-mail</strong> directly is perfectly fine — no install required and the full web app has identical features. The extension becomes the better choice when you need temp email regularly throughout your day and don't want to manage extra browser tabs.
      </p>
      <p>Both the extension and the website connect to the same backend, so addresses and API behaviour are identical. The only difference is the interface — toolbar popup vs full web page.</p>

      <h2>Privacy: What Data Does the Extension Collect?</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing. The extension stores your session token and inbox history locally on your device using Chrome's <code>chrome.storage.local</code> API. This data never leaves your machine except for the API calls needed to generate and check your inbox (which go to <code>xtoolkit.live</code>). There is no user account, no analytics SDK inside the extension, and no data sold or shared with any third party.
      </p>
      <p>You can verify this yourself: the extension's permissions are shown in the Chrome Web Store's <em>Privacy practices</em> tab, and the source code is open for inspection.</p>
